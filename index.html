        <p>In today’s digital world, IT professionals spend long hours in front of computers. This leads to problems like back pain, neck pain, stress, eye strain, and poor posture.
         Yoga is a natural and effective solution to improve both physical and mental health for IT professionals.Without yoga, an IT professional’s
         day often starts rushed, continues with long hours of sitting, heavy caffeine use, and ends in fatigue with poor sleep. 
         With yoga, mornings begin refreshed with mindful stretches, work hours are supported by better posture and focus, and evenings close with 
         relaxation practices. This simple shift brings balance, reduces stress, and improves both productivity and overall well-being.
